# BookLook
A Book Reviewer

This is a simple add intended for the purpose of allowing Users/Reviewers to talk about the books that interest them.
Simlar to the Review system of some other shopping websites. Reviewrs can psot thier thoughts on the various books they have read.
The Super Users/Admin can eaisly edit or remove the database.

Unlike those other review systems, it does not have its own catalog of books. It is framed as a social review forum first.
So it would be best paired up with a book or library catalog. 

(Please note this is my first Tango with Django so anticiate posible bugs.)
